# Weather-Prediction-Analysis
This project performs an in-depth analysis of weather data to predict if it will rain the next day. It explores the dataset through visualization, handles class imbalance using oversampling, deals with missing values, and investigates feature correlations. The app is built using Streamlit, making the analysis interactive and user-friendly.
